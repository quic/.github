## QuIC Repolinter GitHub Action

QuIC repos should enable the Repolinter GitHub Action upon creation. This action runs the Repolinter tool, which lints open source repositories for common issues.

### Initial setup

1. Navigate to the new repo
1. Click on Actions
1. If you have existing actions in the repo, click "New workflow", else skip to next step
1. Scroll to "Workflows created by Qualcomm Innovation Center" and click "Set up this workflow" under "QuIC Organization Repolinter Workflow"
1. Click "Start commit" and then "Commit new file" after ensuring your QuIC email is listed under "Choose which email address to associate with this commit"
1. This will create a GitHub Action config file in your repo under the path `.github/workflows/quic-organization-repolinter.yml`
1. Adjust it as needed, e.g. the Repolinter action is configured to run on Push and Pull Requests into the main/master branch, but you may want to further adjust when it runs.

### Customizing Repolinter rules

When the GitHub Action is run, it first checks your QuIC repo for a local `repolint.json` file at the root directory. If it doesn't find one it'll use the default QuIC Repolinter ruleset, which is located here https://github.com/quic/.github/blob/main/repolint.json

To customize the default QuIC repolinter ruleset (e.g. to add some language specific file extensions for the license check), copy the `repolint.json` file (from https://github.com/quic/.github/blob/main/repolint.json) and place it at the root of your QuIC repo. Now you can edit and tweak it as applicable.
